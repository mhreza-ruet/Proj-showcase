## Laplacian Blob Detector using 2D CNN

This project was developed as part of an image processing course, focusing on detecting **Laplacian blobs** using a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal was to combine classical image processing concepts with modern deep learning approaches.

### Project Highlights
- Implemented a **2D CNN** architecture from scratch for blob detection.  
- Designed the pipeline to identify blob-like structures using the **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)** operator as the theoretical foundation.  
- Compared the CNN-based detection approach against traditional blob detection methods.  
- Emphasis placed on understanding the relationship between **image filtering** and **convolutional feature extraction**.

### Skills Demonstrated
- CNN architecture design and training  
- Blob detection and feature localization  
- Classical image processing (Laplacian of Gaussian)  
- Practical experience combining theory with deep learning
